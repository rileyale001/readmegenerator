# 09 Node.js Homework: Professional README Generator# team-profilegenerator

## Task

To create a readme generator!
For this project I am creating a readme generator so that when a user is prompted with questions they can select those criteria for their project and then a READ.md file is generated.

## Javascript

- Created a function that returns a license badge based on which license is passed in
- Created a function that returns the license link
- Created a function that returns the license section of README
- Create a function to generate markdown for README
- code implempted using node index.js
- When a user is given a command line they are prompted with a series of questions
- inquirer used for node package
- data was stored in variables so WHEN a user enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instruction
- license was changed in generateMarkdown so that a license will render
- user enters contact info and the readme is generated
